Network configuration.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.25.0-preview/library/network.html

This module provides network drivers and routing configuration. To use this
module, a MicroPython variant/build with network capabilities must be installed.
Network drivers for specific hardware are available within this module and are
used to configure hardware network interface(s). Network services provided
by configured interfaces are then available for use via the :mod:`socket`
module.

For example::

    # connect/ show IP config a specific network interface
    # see below for examples of specific drivers
    import network
    import time
    nic = network.Driver(...)
    if not nic.isconnected():
        nic.connect()
        print("Waiting for connection...")
        while not nic.isconnected():
            time.sleep(1)
    print(nic.ipconfig("addr4"))

    # now use socket as usual
    import socket
    addr = socket.getaddrinfo('micropython.org', 80)[0][-1]
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect(addr)
    s.send(b'GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: micropython.org

')
    data = s.recv(1000)
    s.close()

    Create a LAN driver object, initialise the LAN module using the given
    PHY driver name, and return the LAN object.

    Arguments are:

      - *id* is the number of the Ethernet port, either 0 or 1.
      - *phy_type* is the name of the PHY driver. For most board the on-board PHY has to be used and
        is the default. Suitable values are port specific.
      - *phy_addr* specifies the address of the PHY interface. As with *phy_type*, the hardwired value has
        to be used for most boards and that value is the default.
      - *ref_clk_mode* specifies, whether the data clock is provided by the Ethernet controller or
        the PYH interface.
        The default value is the one that matches the board. If set to ``LAN.OUT`` or ``Pin.OUT``
        or ``True``, the clock is driven by the Ethernet controller, if set to ``LAN.IN``
        or ``Pin.IN`` or ``False``, the clock is driven by the PHY interface.

    For example, with the Seeed Arch Mix board you can  use::

      nic = LAN(0, phy_type=LAN.PHY_LAN8720, phy_addr=1, ref_clk_mode=Pin.IN)
