        (Re-)initialise a pulse counter unit. Supported keyword arguments are:

          - ``channel``: see description below
          - ``pin``: the input Pin to monitor for pulses
          - ``rising``: an action to take on a rising edge - one of
            ``PCNT.INCREMENT``, ``PCNT.DECREMENT`` or ``PCNT.IGNORE`` (the default)
          - ``falling``: an action to take on a falling edge (takes the save values
            as the ``rising`` argument).
          - ``mode_pin``: ESP32 pulse counters support monitoring a second pin and
            altering the behaviour of the counter based on its level - set this
            keyword to any input Pin
          - ``mode_low``: set to either ``PCNT.HOLD`` or ``PCNT.REVERSE`` to
            either suspend counting or reverse the direction of the counter (i.e.,
            ``PCNT.INCREMENT`` behaves as ``PCNT.DECREMENT`` and vice versa)
            when ``mode_pin`` is low
          - ``mode_high``: as ``mode_low`` but for the behaviour when ``mode_pin``
            is high
          - ``filter``: set to a value 1..1023, in ticks of the 80MHz clock, to
            enable the pulse width filter
          - ``min``: set to the minimum level of the counter value when
            decrementing (-32768..-1) or 0 to disable
          - ``max``: set to the maximum level of the counter value when
            incrementing (1..32767) or 0 to disable
          - ``threshold0``: sets the counter value for the
            ``PCNT.IRQ_THRESHOLD0`` event (see ``irq`` method)
          - ``threshold1``: sets the counter value for the
            ``PCNT.IRQ_THRESHOLD1`` event (see ``irq`` method)
          - ``value``: can be set to ``0`` to reset the counter value

        The hardware initialisation is done in stages and so some of the keyword
        arguments can be used in groups or in isolation to partially reconfigure a
        unit:

          - the ``pin`` keyword (optionally combined with ``mode_pin``) can be used
            to change just the bound pin(s)
          - ``rising``, ``falling``, ``mode_low`` and ``mode_high`` can be used
            (singly or together) to change the counting logic - omitted keywords
            use their default (``PCNT.IGNORE`` or ``PCNT.NORMAL``)
          - ``filter`` can be used to change only the pulse width filter (with 0
            disabling it)
          - each of ``min``, ``max``, ``threshold0`` and ``threshold1`` can
            be used to change these limit/event values individually; however,
            setting any will reset the counter to zero (i.e., they imply
            ``value=0``)

        Each pulse counter unit supports two channels, 0 and 1, each able to
        monitor different pins with different counting logic but updating the same
        counter value. Use ``channel=1`` with the ``pin``, ``rising``, ``falling``,
        ``mode_pin``, ``mode_low`` and ``mode_high`` keywords to configure the
        second channel.

        The second channel can be used to configure 4X quadrature decoding with a
        single counter unit::

            pin_a = Pin(2, Pin.INPUT, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)
            pin_b = Pin(3, Pin.INPUT, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)

    is available to ESP-IDF and the networking stack in particular. It may shed
    some light on situations where ESP-IDF operations fail due to allocation failures.

    The capabilities parameter corresponds to ESP-IDF's ``MALLOC_CAP_XXX`` values but the
    two most useful ones are predefined as `esp32.HEAP_DATA` for data heap regions and
    `esp32.HEAP_EXEC` for executable regions as used by the native code emitter.

    The return value is a list of 4-tuples, where each 4-tuple corresponds to one heap
    and contains: the total bytes, the free bytes, the largest free block, and
    the minimum free seen over time.
